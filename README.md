# CVE Tracker

This is a CVE tracker that I'm gonna open source to make it usable for others as I found myself needing something like this that doesn't require a subscription of some kind to a paid product/service.

## Features

- [x] Pulls latest cvelistV5 changes from repo
- [x] Extracts CVEs for the current year
- [ ] \*Categorizes CVEs based on what they affect OR by applications they affect (maybe ping an API for checking service types?)
- [ ] For now, v1 dumps data via CLI
