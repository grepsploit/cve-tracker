# CVE Tracker

This is a CVE tracker that I'm gonna open source to make it usable for others as I found myself needing something like this that doesn't require a subscription of some kind to a paid product/service.

## Features

- [x] Pulls latest cvelistV5 changes from repo
- [x] Extracts CVEs for the current year
- [ ] \*Categorizes CVEs based on what they affect OR by applications they affect (maybe ping an API for checking service types?)
- [x] For now, v1 dumps data via CLI

## Requirements

I'm not yet putting any specific usage for any particular architectures because I'm not compiling for any of them currently, so if you're interested in using CVE Tracker, you can build it yourself, but the requirement is that you have Go (version 1.22+) on your system.

## Usage

As mentioned in the requirements section, to build or run this, you need to have Go on your system. Once you have it on your system:

**Clone CVE Tracker**
```bash
~/$ git clone https://github.com/grepsploit/cve-tracker
~/$ cd cve-tracker
```

**Build and Run**
```bash
~/cve-tracker$ go build .
~/cve-tracker$ ./cve-tracker
```

If you don't want to build it and only run it, you can just use:
```bash
~/cve-tracker$ go run .
```
